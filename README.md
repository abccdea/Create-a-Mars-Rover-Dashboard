# Functional Programming with Javascript 

## Big Picture

This project is created Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API.  Dashboard allows the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. The app makes use of all the functional concepts and practices learnt in Udacity course, and the goal is to become very comfortable using pure functions and iterating over, reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses. 

## How it works

## Getting Started

1. For this project I used npm as a package manager, install your depencies:

```npm install``` 

2. In order to see the website working you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. 

3. Create .env file and replace with API key.

5. Run `npm start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3005`. The page should now be working.
